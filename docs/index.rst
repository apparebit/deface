deface: Liberating Your Posts From Facebook
===========================================

The **deface** command line tool and library clean and consolidate the post data
from ``posts/your_posts_n.json`` files in personal archives exported from
Facebook. That makes it easier to extricate your content and hence yourself from
the social network. Doing so matters because Facebook is an imminent threat to
human rights and democracy all over the world. I presented the (dispassionate)
`case against Facebook <https://youtu.be/iYJQSfQGDEE>`_ as an invited talk at
`Rebase
<http://rebase-conf.org/2020/#technology-today-a-paucity-of-integrity-and-imagination>`_/`SPLASH
<https://2020.splashcon.org>`_ in November 2020.
