Deface
======

*Liberate your posts from Facebook!*

**deface** ingests one or more ``posts/your_posts_n.json`` files from personal
data archives that have been exported from Facebook, cleans and simplifies the
data, including the removal of redundant information, and prints the result in
chronological order to the console. You have a choice between pretty-printed,
newline-delimited, or plain JSON for output.

By helping you extricate your content from Facebook, **deface** also helps you
extricate yourself from the social network. That matters because Facebook is an
imminent threat to human rights and democracy all over the world. I made just
that case in `an invited talk <https://youtu.be/iYJQSfQGDEE>`_ at `Rebase
<http://rebase-conf.org/2020/#technology-today-a-paucity-of-integrity-and-imagination>`_
/ `SPLASH <https://2020.splashcon.org>`_ in November 2020.
