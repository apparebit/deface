Deface
======

*Liberate your posts from Facebook!*

*deface* ingests one or more ``posts/your_posts_n.json`` files exported from
Facebook, cleans and simplifies the contained post data, including removing
redundant information, and prints the result in chronological order to the
console. You have a choice between pretty-printed, newline-delimited, or plain
JSON for output.

By helping to extricate your content from Facebook, *deface* also helps to
extricate yourself from the social network. That matters because Facebook is an
imminent threat to human rights and democracy all over the world. I made just
that case in `an invited talk <https://youtu.be/iYJQSfQGDEE>`_ at `Rebase
<http://rebase-conf.org/2020/#technology-today-a-paucity-of-integrity-and-imagination>`_
/ `SPLASH <https://2020.splashcon.org>`_ in November 2020.
