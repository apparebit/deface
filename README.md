# deface: Liberate Your Posts From Facebook

*deface* cleans and consolidates posts exported from Facebook. It helps you
extricate your content from Facebook, so that you can extricate yourself from
the social network. That matters because Facebook is an imminent threat to human
rights and democracy all over the world. I made [the case against
Facebook](https://youtu.be/iYJQSfQGDEE) as an invited talk at
[Rebase](http://rebase-conf.org/2020/#technology-today-a-paucity-of-integrity-and-imagination)/[SPLASH](https://2020.splashcon.org)
in November 2020.

To install *deface*:

```shell
$ pip install deface-social
```

To run *deface*:

```shell
$ deface -h
```
